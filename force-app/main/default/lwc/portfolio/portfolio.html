            <h1>Akshara Srivastava</h1>
            <p>I am a recent B.Tech graduate in Computer Science and Engineering
                with hands-on experience in building dynamic and responsive
                applications on the Salesforce platform. I have a solid understanding of
                Salesforce development tools such as Apex, Lightning Web
                Components (LWC), SOQL, and Flow. I specialize in custom component
                development, API integrations, and automating business processes to
                enhance user experience and operational efficiency. With a strong
                foundation in problem-solving and a keen interest in CRM solutions, I
                am committed to delivering scalable, high-quality solutions that align
                with business goals.
